# Vision Statement
Our goal for this ISP is to create an immersive game that responds to the player's input, beyond just minor outcomes that have a small effect on the overall gameplay. As a user plays, they should be able to observe the influence&mdash;whether good or bad&mdash;of the things they choose or the actions they make, for an end result of a richer experience with realistic characters and choices that have a long term impact throughout the plot.
